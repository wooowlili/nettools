## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes._

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **kuiniu**: GPU NIC interconnect probing tool for AI training clusters
  - GPU pair model with parallel `local_gpu_addrs` / `remote_gpu_addrs` arrays
  - JSON config file with CLI flag override support
  - `role=both` for single-process client + server with `localGPUSet` self-echo guard
  - Concurrent client/server execution under shared context/processor/logger
  - 4-Salt bit-flip detection on RoCEv2/UDP paths
  - Logs to both terminal and file, with key milestone logs at startup
  - Continues running when client/server `Run()` returns error (no process exit)
- `util.RotateWriter`: shared daily-rotated log writer with stable symlink and prefix-isolated pruning, used by both `baize` and `kuiniu`
- Per-tool documentation page `docs/kuiniu.html`; `docs/index.html` updated with kuiniu section, tool index entry, and comparison table column
- Unit tests for `kuiniu/config`, `kuiniu/client`, `kuiniu/server`, `kuiniu/transport`, `ping`, `ping6`, and `util.salts`

### Fixed
- kuiniu client peer matching now uses the correct IP field
- kuiniu server now echoes via the matching GPU network and skips self-echo loops under `role=both`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **mping**: multi-target ICMP Echo ping tool with CIDR expansion, DNS resolution, and hardware timestamping
- **mping6**: IPv6 variant of mping for ICMPv6 Echo probing
- `--hwts` flag to enable/disable hardware timestamping (mping)
- `--max-targets` flag to cap CIDR/DNS target expansion
- Bit-flip detection in mping/mping6 via deterministic salts (shared `util` package)
- `install.sh` automated binary installation script, with install docs in README and website
- mping/mping6 documentation pages
- mping/mping6 packaging in Makefile and goreleaser config

### Fixed
- mping6 100% packet-loss issues: ICMPv6 socket binding (`SOCK_RAW` bound to `::`), receive-path dissection order, and Linux local address/interface auto-detection
- Docs: tool count, latency reporting, and mping bitflip-detection description

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `--version` flag for all CLI tools, populated via `-ldflags` injection at build time

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed
- goreleaser now packages all binaries into a single `nettools` archive per OS/arch (separate per-build entries)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- GoReleaser config and GitHub release workflow

### Removed
- Custom `go-badges` job in favor of standard badge sources

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

Initial open-source release.

### Added
- **bitflip**: IPv4 packet loss and bit-flip detection with dedicated client/server
- **bitflip6**: IPv6 variant of bitflip
- **baize**: configuration-driven continuous network quality monitoring tool
- **lidar**: TCP SYN probing tool for network reachability detection (no server-side deployment), with Linux raw-socket support and classic BPF filter
- Switch from gopacket to goscapy for packet construction
- GitHub Actions CI
- Unit tests for `lidar` and `stat` packages
